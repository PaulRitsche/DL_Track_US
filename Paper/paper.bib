	abstract = {Ultrasound (US) imaging has been widely used in both research and clinical settings to evaluate the morphological and mechanical properties of muscle and tendon. In elite sports scenarios, a regular assessment of such properties has great potential, namely for testing the response to training, detecting athletes at higher risks of injury, screening athletes for structural abnormalities related to current or future musculoskeletal complaints, and monitoring their return to sport after a musculoskeletal injury. However, several practical and methodological aspects of US techniques should be considered when applying this technology in the elite sports context. Therefore, this narrative review aims to (1) present the principal US measures and field of applications in the context of elite sports; (2) to discuss, from a methodological perspective, the strengths and shortcomings of US imaging for the assessment of muscle and tendon properties; and (3) to provide future directions for research and application.},

	abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more eﬃciently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caﬀe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.},

Manual digitisation of these images is time consuming and algorithms for automating the process have been developed. Here we present a freely available software implementation of a previously validated algorithm for semi-automated tracking of muscle fascicle length in dynamic ultrasound image recordings, “UltraTrack”.
Methods: UltraTrack implements an afﬁne extension to an optic ﬂow algorithm to track movement of the muscle fascicle end-points throughout dynamically recorded sequences of images. The underlying algorithm has been previously described and its reliability tested, but here we present the software implementation with features for: tracking multiple fascicles in multiple muscles simultaneously; correcting temporal drift in measurements; manually adjusting tracking results; saving and re-loading of tracking results and loading a range of ﬁle formats.
Results: Two example runs of the software are presented detailing the tracking of fascicles from several lower limb muscles during a squatting and walking activity.

	abstract = {Background: Ultrasound has become a commonly used imaging modality for making dynamic measurements of muscle structure during functional movements in biomechanical studies. Manual measurements of fascicle length and pennation angle are time intensive which limits the clinical utility of this approach while also limiting sample sizes in research. The purpose of this study was to develop an automatic fascicle tracking program to quantify the length and pennation angle of a muscle fascicle during maximal effort voluntary contractions and to evaluate its repeatability between days and reproducibility between different examiners.
Methods: Five healthy adults performed maximal effort isometric and isokinetic contractions at 30, 120, 210, and 500 degrees per second about their ankle on an isokinetic dynamometer while their medial gastrocnemius muscle was observed using ultrasound. Individual muscle fascicles and the two aponeuroses were identiﬁed by the user in the ﬁrst frame and automatically tracked by the algorithm by three observers on three separate days. Users also made manual measurements of the candidate fascicle for validation. Repeatability within examiners across days and reproducibility across examiners and days were evaluated using intra-class correlation coefﬁcients (ICC). Agreement between manual and automatic tracking was evaluated using the coefﬁcient of multiple correlations (CMC) and root-mean-square error. Supervised automatic tracking, where the program could be reinitialized if poor tracking was observed, was performed on all videos by one examiner to evaluate the performance of automatic tracking in a typical use case. We also compared the performance our program to a preexisting automatic tracking program.
Results: We found both manual and automatic measurements of fascicle length and pennation angle to be strongly repeatable within examiners and strongly reproducible across examiners and days (ICCs {\textgreater} 0.74). There was greater agreement between manual and automatic measurements of fascicle length than pennation angle, however the mean CMC value was found to be strong in both cases (CMC {\textgreater} 0.8). Supervision of automatic tracking showed very strong agreement between manual and automatic measurements of fascicle length and pennation angle (CMC {\textgreater} 0.94). It also had considerably less error relative to the preexisting automatic tracking program.
Conclusions: We have developed a novel automatic fascicle tracking algorithm that quantiﬁes fascicle length and pennation angle of individual muscle fascicles during dynamic contractions during isometric and across a range of isokinetic velocities.},

	abstract = {The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a largescale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 5001000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classiﬁcation and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle size is an important factor in assessing adaptation to exercise training and detraining, athletic performance, age-associated atrophy and mobility decline, clinical conditions associated with cachexia, and overall skeletal muscle health. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) are widely accepted as the gold standard methods for skeletal muscle size quantiﬁcation. However, it is not always feasible to use these methods (e.g., ﬁeld studies, bedside studies, and large cohort studies). Ultrasound has been available for skeletal muscle examination for more than 50 years and the development, utility, and validity of ultrasound imaging are underappreciated. It is now possible to use ultrasound in situations where MR and CT imaging are not suitable. This review provides a comprehensive summary of ultrasound imaging and human skeletal muscle size assessment. Since the ﬁrst study in 1968, more than 600 articles have used ultrasound to examine the cross-sectional area and/or volume of 107 different skeletal muscles in more than 27,500 subjects of various ages, health status, and ﬁtness conditions. Data from these studies, supported by decades of technological developments, collectively show that ultrasonography is a valid tool for skeletal muscle size quantiﬁcation. Considering the wide-ranging connections between human health and function and skeletal muscle mass, the utility of ultrasound imaging will allow it to be employed in research investigations and clinical practice in ways not previously appreciated or considered.},

	abstract = {During human locomotion lower extremity muscle-tendon units undergo cyclic length changes that were previously assumed to be representative of muscle fascicle length changes. Measurements in cats and humans have since revealed that muscle fascicle length changes can be uncoupled from those of the muscle-tendon unit. Ultrasonography is frequently used to estimate fascicle length changes during human locomotion. Fascicle length analysis requires time consuming manual methods that are prone to human error and experimenter bias. To bypass these limitations, we have developed an automatic fascicle tracking method based on the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm with an affine optic flow extension. The aims of this study were to compare gastrocnemius fascicle length changes during locomotion using the automated and manual approaches and to determine the repeatability of the automated approach. Ultrasound was used to examine gastrocnemius fascicle lengths in eight participants walking at 4, 5, 6, and 7 km/h and jogging at 7 km/h on a treadmill. Ground reaction forces and three dimensional kinematics were recorded simultaneously. The level of agreement between methods and the repeatability of the automated method were quantified using the coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC). Regardless of speed, the level of agreement between methods was high, with overall CMC values of 0.90 ± 0.09 (95\% CI: 0.86–0.95). Repeatability of the algorithm was also high, with an overall CMC of 0.88 ± 0.08 (95\% CI: 0.79–0.96). The automated fascicle tracking method presented here is a robust, reliable, and time-efficient alternative to the manual analysis of muscle fascicle length during gait.},

	abstract = {In vivo measurements of muscle architecture (i.e. the spatial arrangement of muscle fascicles) are routinely included in research and clinical settings to monitor muscle structure, function and plasticity. However, in most cases such measurements are performed manually, and more reliable and time-efficient automated methods are either lacking completely, or are inaccessible to those without expertise in image analysis. In this work, we propose an ImageJ script to automate the entire analysis process of muscle architecture in ultrasound images: Simple Muscle Architecture Analysis (SMA). Images are filtered in the spatial and frequency domains with built-in commands and external plugins to highlight aponeuroses and fascicles. Fascicle dominant orientation is then computed in regions of interest using the OrientationJ plugin. Bland-Altman plots of analyses performed manually or with SMA indicate that the automated analysis does not induce any systematic bias and that both methods agree equally through the range of measurements. Our test results illustrate the suitability of SMA to analyse images from superficial muscles acquired with a broad range of ultrasound settings.},

	abstract = {B-mode ultrasound can be used to non-invasively image muscle fascicles during both static and dynamic contractions. Digitizing these muscle fascicles can be a timely and subjective process, and usually studies have used the images to determine the linear fascicle lengths. However, fascicle orientations can vary along each fascicle (curvature) and between fascicles. The purpose of this study was to develop and test two methods for automatically tracking fascicle orientation. Images were initially ﬁltered using a multiscale vessel enhancement (a technique used to enhance tube-like structures), and then fascicle orientations quantiﬁed using either the Radon transform or wavelet analysis. Tests on synthetic images showed that these methods could identify fascicular orientation with errors of less than 0.061. Manual digitization of muscle fascicles during a dynamic contraction resulted in a standard deviation of angle estimates of 1.411 across ten researchers. The Radon transform predicted fascicle orientations that were not signiﬁcantly different from the manually digitized values, whilst the wavelet analysis resulted in angles that were 1.351 less, and reasons for these differences are discussed. The Radon transform can be used to identify the dominant fascicular orientation within an image, and thus used to estimate muscle fascicle lengths. The wavelet analysis additionally provides information on the local fascicle orientations and can be used to quantify fascicle curvatures and regional differences with fascicle orientation across an image.},

In this study, we focus on full spatial analysis of muscle ﬁbre orientation, since there is an existing body of work with which to compare results. Previous attempts to automatically estimate ﬁbre orientation from ultrasound are not adequate, often requiring manual region selection, feature engineering, providing low-resolution estimations (one angle per muscle) and deep muscles are often not attempted. We build upon our previous work in which automatic segmentation was used with plain convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep residual convolutional network (ResNet) architectures, to predict a low-resolution map of ﬁbre orientation in extracted muscle regions. Here, we use deconvolutions and max-unpooling (DCNN) to regularise and improve predicted ﬁbre orientation maps for the entire image, including deep muscles, removing the need for automatic segmentation and we compare our results with the CNN and ResNet, as well as a previously established feature engineering method, on the same task. Dynamic ultrasound images sequences of the calf muscles were acquired (25 Hz) from 8 healthy volunteers (4 male, ages: 25–36, median 30). A combination of expert annotation and interpolation/extrapolation provided labels of regional ﬁbre orientation for each image. Neural networks (CNN, ResNet, DCNN) were then trained both with and without dropout using leave one out cross-validation. Our results demonstrated robust estimation of full spatial ﬁbre orientation within approximately 6◦ error, which was an improvement on previous methods.},

	abstract = {Purpose  The assessment of muscle architecture with B-mode ultrasound is an established method in muscle physiology and mechanics. There are several manual, semi-automated and automated approaches available for muscle architecture analysis from ultrasound images or videos. However, most approaches have limitations such as workload, subjectivity, drift or they are applicable to short muscle fascicles only. Addressing these issues, an algorithm was developed to analyse architectural parameters of the vastus lateralis muscle (VL).
Methods  In 17 healthy young men and women, ultrasound images were taken five times on two different days during passive knee joint flexion. From the images, fascicle length (FL), pennation angle (PAN) and muscle thickness (MTH) were calculated for both test days using the algorithm. Interday differences were determined using a two-way ANOVA. Interday and intraday reliability were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and root mean square (RMS) differences.
Results  FL, MTH and PAN did not differ between day one and two. The within day ICCs were above 0.94 for all tested parameters. The average interday ICCs were 0.86 for the FL, 0.96 for MTH and 0.60 for PAN. The average RMS differences between both days were 5.0\%, 8.5\% and 12.0\% for MTH, FL and PAN, respectively.
Conclusion  The proposed algorithm provides high measurement reliability. However, the interday reliability might be influenced by small differences in probe position between days.},
