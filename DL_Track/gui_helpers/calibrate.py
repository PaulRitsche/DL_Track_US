Description
-----------
This module contains functions to automatically or manually
scale images.
The scope of the automatic method is limited to scaling bars being
present in the right side of the image. The scope of the manual method
is not limited to specific scaling types in images. However, the distance
between two selected points in the image required for the scaling must be
known.

Functions scope
---------------
mclick
    Instance method to detect mouse click coordinates in image.
calibrateDistanceManually
    Function to manually calibrate an image to convert measurements
    in pixel units to centimeters.
calibrateDistanceStatic
    Function to calibrate an image to convert measurements
    in pixel units to centimeters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    event
        Event flag specified as Cv2 mouse event left mouse button down.
    x_val
        Value of x-coordinate of mouse event to be recorded.

def calibrateDistanceManually(img: np.ndarray, spacing: int):
    """
    Function to manually calibrate an image to convert measurements
    in pixel units to centimeters.

    The function calculates the distance in pixel units between two
    points on the input image. The points are determined by clicks of
    the user. The distance (in milimeters) is determined by the value
    contained in the spacing variable. Then the ratio of pixel / centimeter
    is calculated. To get the distance, the euclidean distance between the
    two points is calculated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img : np.ndarray
        Input image to be analysed as a numpy array. The image must
        be loaded prior to calibration, specifying a path
        is not valid.
    spacing : int
        Integer variable containing the known distance in milimeter
        between the two placed points by the user. This can be 5, 10,
        15 or 20 milimeter.

    Returns
    -------
        calib_dist : int
            Integer variable containing the distance between the two
            specified point in pixel units.
        scale_statement : str
            String variable containing a statement how many milimeter
            correspond to how many pixels.

    --------

def calibrateDistanceStatic(img: np.ndarray, spacing: str):
    """
    Function to calibrate an image to convert measurements
    in pixel units to centimeter.

    The function calculates the distance in pixel units between two
    scaling bars on the input image. The bars should be positioned on the
    right side of image. The distance (in milimeter) between two bars must
    be specified by the spacing variable. It is the known distance between two
    bars in milimeter. Then the ratio of pixel / centimeter is calculated.
    To get the distance, the median distance between two detected bars
    is calculated.
