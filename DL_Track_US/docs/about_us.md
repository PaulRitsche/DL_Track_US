# ✨ About DL_Track_US

---

## Mission

Our mission is to make **deep learning-based muscle architecture analysis** accessible to researchers, students, and clinicians working with musculoskeletal ultrasound.  
**DL_Track_US** provides an intuitive graphical interface to segment and analyze fascicles and aponeuroses, allowing cutting-edge research without requiring advanced programming skills.

---

## Goals

- Democratize the use of **deep learning** for ultrasound image and video analysis.
- Provide a **user-friendly** and **customizable** software platform.
- Foster **open-science practices** by making the tool freely available.
- Continuously **improve segmentation accuracy** through updates and community feedback.

---

## Roadmap

✅ Current Version (v0.2.1) includes:

- Automated and manual analysis of images and videos.
- Fascicle, aponeurosis segmentation and muscle parameter extraction.
- Model training module.
- Video preprocessing tools (cropping, resizing, anonymization).

🔜 Future Plans:

- Add intuitive manual labelling tools.
- Combine with feature tracking algorithm, e.g., Lucas-Kanade or kalman filter.
- Finalize fascicle curvature estimation and consideration.
- Extend model architectures (e.g., attention U-Nets, transformers).
- Broaden community contribution possibilities.
