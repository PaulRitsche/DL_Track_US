Description
-----------
This module contains functions to automatically or manually
analyse muscle architecture in longitudinal ultrasonography images
of human lower limb muscles.
The scope of the automatic method is limited to the vastus
lateralis, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius medialis and soleus muscles
due to training data availability.
The scope of the manual method is not limited to specific muscles.
The module was specifically designed to be executed from a GUI.
When used from the GUI, the module saves the analysis results in a .xlsx file
to a given directory. The user needs to provide paths to the image, model,
and flipflag file directories.


Functions scope
---------------
importAndReshapeImage
    Function to import and reshape an image. Moreover, based upon
    user specification the image might be flipped.
importImageManual
     Function to import an image.
importFlipFlagsList
     Function to retrieve flip values from a .txt file.
compileSaveResults
     Function to save the analysis results to a .xlsx file.
IoU
    Function to compute the intersection over union score (IoU),
    a measure of prediction accuracy. This is sometimes also called Jaccard
    score.
calculateBatch
    Function to calculate muscle architecture in longitudinal ultrasonography
    images of human lower limb muscles. The values computed are fascicle
    length (FL), pennation angle (PA), and muscle thickness (MT).
calculateBatchManual
    Function used for manual calculation of fascicle length, muscle thickness
    and pennation angles in longitudinal ultrasonography images of human lower
    limb muscles.

    The scope of this function is limited. Images of the vastus lateralis,
    tibialis anterior soleus and gastrocnemius  muscles can be analyzed.
    This is due to the limited amount of training data for our convolutional
    neural networks. This functions makes extensive use
    of several other functions and was designed to be executed from a GUI.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rootpath : str
        String variable containing the path to the folder where all images
        to be analyzed are saved.
    apo_modelpath : str
        String variable containing the absolute path to the aponeurosis
        neural network.
    fasc_modelpath : str
        String variable containing the absolute path to the fascicle
        neural network.
    flip_flag_path : str
        String variabel containing the absolute path to the flip flag
        .txt file containing the flip flags. Flipping is necessary as the
        models were trained on images of with specific fascicle orientation.
    filetype : str
        String variable containg the respective type of the images.
        This is needed to select only the relevant image files
        in the root directory.
    scaling : {"bar", "manual", "No scaling"}
        String variabel determining the image scaling method.
        There are three types of scaling available:
        - scaling = "manual" (user must scale images manually)
        - sclaing = "bar" (image are scaled automatically. This is done by
          detecting scaling bars on the right side of the image.)
        - scaling = "No scaling" (image is not scaled.)
        Scaling is necessary to compute measurements in centimeter,
        if "no scaling" is chosen, the results are in pixel units.
    spacing : {10, 5, 15, 20}
        Distance (in milimeter) between two scaling bars in the image.
        This is needed to compute the pixel/cm ratio and therefore report
        the results in centimeter rather than pixel units.
    filter_fasc : bool
        If True, fascicles will be filtered so that no crossings are included.
        This may reduce number of totally detected fascicles.
    apo_threshold : float
        Float variable containing the threshold applied to predicted
        aponeurosis pixels by our neural networks. By varying this
        threshold, different structures will be classified as
        aponeurosis as the threshold for classifying
        a pixel as aponeurosis is changed. Must be non-zero and
        non-negative.
    fasc_threshold : float
        Float variable containing the threshold applied to predicted fascicle
        pixels by our neural networks. By varying this threshold, different
        structures will be classified as fascicle as the threshold for
        classifying a pixel as fascicle is changed.
    fasc_cont_threshold : float
        Float variable containing the threshold applied to predicted fascicle
        segments by our neural networks. By varying this threshold, different
        structures will be classified as fascicle. By increasing, longer
        fascicle segments will be considered, by lowering shorter segments.
        Must be non-zero and non-negative.
    min_width : int
        Integer variable containing the minimal distance between aponeuroses
        to be detected. The aponeuroses must be at least this distance apart
        to be detected. The distance is specified in pixels.
        Must be non-zero and non-negative.
    min_pennation : int
        Integer variable containing the mininmal (physiological) acceptable
        pennation angle occuring in the analyzed image/muscle. Fascicles
        with lower pennation angles will be excluded.
        The pennation angle is calculated as the amgle of insertion between
        extrapolated fascicle and detected aponeurosis. Must be non-negative.
    max_pennation : int
        Integer variable containing the maximal (physiological) acceptable
        pennation angle occuring in the analyzed image/muscle. Fascicles
        with higher pennation angles will be excluded.
        The pennation angle is calculated as the amgle of insertion between
        extrapolated fascicle and detected aponeurosis. Must be non-negative.
    gui : tk.TK
        A tkinter.TK class instance that represents a GUI. By passing this
        argument, interaction with the GUI is possible i.e., stopping
        the calculation process after each image.

    See Also
    --------
    do_calculations.py for exact description of muscle architecture parameter
    calculation.

    Notes
    -----
    For specific explanations of the included functions see the respective
    function docstrings in this module. To see an examplenary PDF output
    and .xlsx file take at look at the examples provided in the "examples"
    directory.
    This function is called by the GUI. Note that the functioned was
    specifically designed to be called from the GUI. Thus, tk.messagebox
    will pop up when errors are raised even if the GUI is not started.

def calculateBatchManual(rootpath: str, filetype: str, gui):
    """Function used for manual calculation of fascicle length,
    muscle thickness and pennation angles in longitudinal
    ultrasonography images of human lower limb muscles.

    This function is not restricted to any specific muscles. However,
    its use is restricted to a specific method for assessing muscle
    thickness fascicle length and pennation angles.

    - Muscle thickness:
                       Exactly one segment reaching from the superficial to the
                       deep aponeuroses of the muscle must be drawn.
                       If multiple measurement are drawn, these are averaged.
                       Drawing can be started by clickling the left mouse
                       button and keeping it pressed until it is not further
                       required to draw the line (i.e., the other aponeurosis
                       border is reached). Only the respective y-coordinates
                       of the points where the cursor was clicked and released
                       are considered for calculation of muscle thickness.
    - Fascicle length:
                      Exactly three segments along the fascicleof the muscle
                      must be drawn. If multiple fascicle are drawn, their
                      lengths are averaged. Drawing can be started by clickling
                      the left mouse button and keeping it pressed until one
                      segment is finished (mostly where fascicle curvature
                      occurs the other aponeurosis border is reached). Using
                      the euclidean distance, the total fascicle length is
                      computed as a sum of the segments.
    - Pennation angle:
                      Exactly two segments, one along the fascicle
                      orientation, the other along the aponeurosis orientation
                      must be drawn. The line along the aponeurosis must be
                      started where the line along the fascicle ends. If
                      multiple angle are drawn, they are averaged. Drawing can
                      be started by clickling the left mouse button and keeping
                      it pressed until it is not further required to draw the
                      line (i.e., the aponeurosis border is reached by the
                      fascicle). The angle is calculated using the arc-tan
                      function.
    In order to scale the frame, it is required to draw a line of length 10
    milimeter somewhere in the image. The line can be drawn in the same
    fashion as for example the muscle thickness. Here however, the euclidean
    distance is used to calculate the pixel / centimeter ratio. This has to
    be done for every frame.

    We also provide the functionality to extent the muscle aponeuroses to more
    easily extrapolate fascicles. The lines can be drawn in the same fashion as
    for example the muscle thickness.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rootpath : str
        String variable containing the path to the folder where all images
        to be analyzed are saved.
    gui : tk.TK
        A tkinter.TK class instance that represents a GUI. By passing this
        argument, interaction with the GUI is possible i.e., stopping
        the calculation process after each image.

    Notes
    -----
    For specific explanations of the included functions see the respective
    function docstrings in this module. The function outputs an .xlsx
    file in rootpath containing the (averaged) analysis results for each
    image.
